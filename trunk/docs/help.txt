# TouchCursor Manual

## Getting Started

Press and hold the space bar (as if it were a Shift key) to activate 
"cursor mode" and use the home keys as cursor keys.  To return to 
normal typing just release the space bar.

The default layout is shown below, but you can change this on 
the [General Tab][] of the configuration dialog.

In the default TouchCursor layout, all the navigation keys are conveniently under the right 
hand, leaving your left hand free to use Ctrl, Alt and Shift, as normal.

### Practising

To begin with, just run your favorite editor or word processor 
and try moving the cursor around to get a feel for how it works.

For some serious practice, you can try the online [training game][]. 
You can also use the [training mode](#general_tab) option with your
usual editor to force you into the TouchCursor habit.

### Fine tuning

A side effect of using TouchCursor is that the space bar 
doesn't produce a space until you release it.
If this causes problems in some programs, 
you can list them on the [Programs Tab][] and 
TouchCursor will be disabled when you are working with them.

Another side effect is that the space bar doesn't 
auto-repeat. If you miss this, you can easily add a key binding, 
for example "S", that will emit spaces with autorepeat.

Alternatively, you can choose a different activation key.

#### Virtual Machines

Normally TouchCursor will work transparently with virtual machines and remote desktop software
&ndash; You don't need to install it on the guest OS or the remote machine &ndash; 
However, some versions of VMware have an "enhanced virtual keyboard" feature, which bypasses
TouchCursor on the host OS.  You can disable this feature to allow TouchCursor to work.

## Configuration Options

You can access the configuration dialog from the icon in the notification area, 
the start menu or, when TouchCursor is active, by holding down space and 
pressing F5.


[General Tab]: #general_tab
<a name="general_tab"></a>
### General Tab

Contains general options and key bindings

<p class="picture"><img src="screen_general.png" width="416" height="466" alt="general page"></p>

#### Enabled

Enables and disables TouchCursor.  You can also configure this per-program on 
the [Programs Tab][].

#### Training mode

This disables the real cursor keys and any others that are bound.
This can be a little annoying but it does get you accustomed to TouchCursor very quickly.
You will probably want to restrict which programs this happens in 
using the [Programs Tab][].

#### Beep for mistakes

When using training mode, this option will cause TouchCursor to beep when
it ignores a key.

#### Run at startup

Runs TouchCursor when you log on to Windows. 

If you are running TouchCursor from a USB drive 
this will have no effect unless the USB drive is connected when you log on.

#### Show icon in notification area

Shows or hides the icon in the notification area (AKA "system tray"). 

If you hide the icon, you can access the configuration dialog from the 
start menu instead (or by pressing Space+F5, if TouchCursor is active).

#### Check for newer versions weekly

Tells TouchCursor to check the web once a week to
see if there is a newer version available for download.


#### Key bindings

This lets you view and customize the key bindings. 

You can add, edit or remove entries in the list using the buttons. 
Double-clicking an entry will also edit it.
The Reset button resets the bindings to the default values.

#### Activation Key

If you don't want to use Space to activate TouchCursor you can choose a different key from this list.
Note that due to the different ways in which various models of keyboard are wired, 
some combinations of activation key and key bindings may not work.

### Programs Tab

This lets you restrict which programs TouchCursor works with.  

Click the "..." button to edit a list interactively: 
Add a program by dragging the crosshair icon on to the window of the program you want to add.

You can also edit the list directly. 
When adding programs this way, type the executable file names, separated by semicolons.

#### Cursor Mode

You can choose to enable TouchCursor in all programs except those that you specify, or in only the programs that you specify.

#### Training Mode

You can choose to use Training Mode in all programs except those that you specify, or in only the programs that you specify.
These settings combine with the <em>Training Mode</em> checkbox on the <a href="#general_tab">General Tab</a>:
If Training Mode is disabled, these settings have no effect.
